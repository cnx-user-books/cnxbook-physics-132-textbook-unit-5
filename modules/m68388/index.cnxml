I've got six different electrical circuits on me right now.</para><para id="eip-571">There are a lot of things that you might not think of as being an electric circuit, but we can analyze using the properties of circuits, which we are going to discuss over the course of this unit. </para><para id="eip-13">By the end of this unit, we will be able to draw a rough circuit and think about a neuron as a circuit. A cell membrane is essentially a capacitor, so we can think about cell membrane ion transport, so we'll be able to talk a little bit about cell membranes in this context. </para><para id="eip-895">We will introduce what a current is but other than that there are not a lot of new fundamental physics in this unit, we're mostly going to be dealing with the idea that if I put a charge and a potential, I get a potential energy. That is going to be the vast majority of what we're going to be working with. It's really a lot of application of those ideas and seeing how things work.  </para></content>
