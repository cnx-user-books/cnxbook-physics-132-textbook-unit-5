    <para id="import-auto-idm976207696">Essentially, it's two pieces of metal in contact. If you think back to Unit 1 we talked about this photoelectric effect, and we explained how much energy you need to remove electrons from a metal. That was described by the work function, which we used to find how much energy we need to remove an electron from the surface of a metal. </para>

Gold has a work function of about <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mn>5</m:mn><m:mi mathvariant="italic">eV</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">5  eV</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>  and platinum have a work function of about <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mn>6</m:mn><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>3</m:mn></m:mfrac><m:mi mathvariant="italic">eV</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">6 {1} over {3}  eV</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>.

    <para id="import-auto-idm245803744">What's going to happen when we touch these two things together? </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm257706976">Well the electron in the gold is going to slide down because now that's a lower energy state in gold it has a potential energy of <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">−</m:mo><m:mn>5.1</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mi mathvariant="italic">eV</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">-5.1  eV</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math> in platinum it has a potential energy of  <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">−</m:mo><m:mn>6.35</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mi mathvariant="italic">eV</m:mi><m:mi>,</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">-6.35 eV   , </m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math> it can lower its potential energy by <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mn>4</m:mn></m:mfrac></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">1 {1} over {4}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math> electron volt by sliding down. </para>

    <para id="import-auto-idm524425392">What is a battery? </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm519068544">A potential difference that, if I connect the two metals across the terminals the electrons spontaneously move. This is essentially the simplest battery I can think of. Now this isn't a very good battery because the electrons from the gold are going to kind of run across which means we’re going to end up with a negatively charged piece of platinum and a positively charged piece of gold. And eventually this repulsion is going to stop the flow, you're going to build up a negatively charged thing and electrons aren't going to flow anymore. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm253872480">So that's what makes this kind of a crummy battery, the electrons flow once and then they stop pretty quickly, you get kind of a spark, you don't get a constant flow. But the potential difference between the two metals states that you keep that potential difference, the electrons just stop flowing because the repulsion. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm448828992">The battery we just talked about, the gold and platinum in contact, well that's not particularly helpful because the electrons flow once and then you're done. We want the battery to keep running, so we're actually going to repeat a famous experiment by a guy named Volta, and so for his setup, shown below, we have a piece of copper and a piece of zinc, and they're not touching each other, and we have no potential difference between them. Then we bring them into contact.</para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm509456240">Then we've got <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mn>1.5</m:mn><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">1.5</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math> moles per liter sulfuric acid and add this in until there's enough in there to bring the two metals into contact, through the sulfuric acid. So now we're getting a potential difference between these two pieces of metal, because now we've dropped them into contact using the sulfuric acid. </para>
    <para id="eip-503"><figure id="eip-idm456094384"><media id="fig" alt="cell" display="inline"><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/vcell.png" width="300" print-width="3in"/></media><caption>A voltaic cell. (credit: Wikipedia)</caption></figure></para><para id="import-auto-idm514817216">This is the first battery voltage, and you can see this potential difference is just sitting there, and these electrons keep flowing. In sulfuric acid, the potential of an electron in zinc is <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mn>3.68</m:mn><m:mi>V</m:mi><m:mi mathvariant="italic">olts</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">3.68  V olts</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>, the fact that there is sulfuric acid changes these work function numbers. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm227033248">The charge of an electron is negative, so zinc has an electron and zinc has a potential energy of <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">−</m:mo><m:mn>6.38</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mi mathvariant="italic">eV</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">- 6.38 eV</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>, an electron in the copper has a potential energy of <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mo stretchy="false">−</m:mo><m:mn>4.78</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mi mathvariant="italic">eV</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">-4.78 eV</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>. This number is bigger, and so electrons will flow to the lower energy state, which is towards the copper, because electrons go against the potential, from low potential to high potential. </para>
    <exercise id="eip-330"><label/><title><media id="inote2i" alt="the umass logo" display="inline"><image mime-type="image/png" src="../../media/umass-logo5.png" width="300" print-width="3in"/></media></title><problem id="inote2p"><para id="inote2pp">Be careful here we're talking about electrons moving and usually when you're dealing with electronics that's what's going on, but not always in a cell. For example, you can and often do have positive charges moving potassium ions, sodium ions, calcium ions, so those charges would move from high potential to low potential, because they're positive, electrons go low to high, so you got to think about what's actually doing the moving. </para></problem></exercise><para id="import-auto-idm850874576">Now let's go through and actually talk through how this thing keeps running. So, the gold-platinum, when we put them in contact the electrons run across and they stopped, because it's a buildup of charge and the repulsion stops the thing from going. Why does the zinc-copper keep going? Well zinc dissolves in sulfuric acid, and you spit off a Zinc 2<sup>+</sup> ion, which will eventually precipitate out a zinc sulfate. What does that leave behind in the metal? Electrons. Zinc 2<sup>+</sup> popped off, now I've got two electrons, and now my zinc has a slight negative charge to it. Well we just said that copper is the lower energy state, so the electrons would prefer to be in copper because it's a lower energy state. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm520326064"> They go over and run through the wire because it's less resistance to run through the wire than to run through the solution. We would have the same problem that we did with our platinum-gold we'd eventually build up charges on this side and the whole thing would stop, but the solution comes in again. Because it's sulfuric acid, there's these positive hydrogen ions sitting in there and these electrons are attracted to these positive hydrogen ions and jump off. Which then form a nice diatomic hydrogen, which bubbles out and now we're back where we started. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm612528880">We have neutral-zinc, neutral-copper and the whole thing can just keep going, and so we can continue moving these electrons across and the reaction doesn't stop because we come back to a neutral state each time and we maintain a fixed potential difference.</para>
